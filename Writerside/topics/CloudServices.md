# Cloud Services

### Firebase

[Firebase, Inc.](https://firebase.google.com/) is a set of backend cloud computing services and application development
platforms provided by Google. It
hosts databases, services, authentication, and integration for a variety of applications, including Android, iOS,
JavaScript, Node.js, Java, Unity, PHP, C++ and other [solutions](https://firebase.google.com/solutions).

<note>
The following are the intended Firebase/Google cloud services that will be used
</note>

#### Authentication

Under the Authentication service, Firebase provides robust user authentication and authorization features. It allows
developers to easily manage user identities, including email/password, phone number, and social login methods.

#### Firebase Machine Learning

Firebase Machine Learning, in addition to its standalone capabilities, is further bolstered by Google's Vertex AI. This
collaboration enhances developers' ability to seamlessly integrate machine learning models into their applications,
offering advanced features such as image labeling, text recognition, and custom model hosting. This synergy empowers
developers to create robust AI-driven experiences with ease.
