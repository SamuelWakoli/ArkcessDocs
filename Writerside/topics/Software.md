### Operating System

#### Ubuntu Linux

[Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/developers) is the top choice for software development, offering robust
features, flexibility, and extensive developer support. Renowned for stability and reliability, it provides a secure
environment for building, testing, and deploying applications. With its open-source nature, Ubuntu boasts a vast
repository of tools, libraries, and frameworks, allowing developers to customize their environment. Compatibility with
popular programming languages ensures seamless integration with various workflows. Its active developer community
provides invaluable resources, tutorials, and support, making Ubuntu one of the optimal OS for software development
worldwide.

### Development Tools

#### Cloud Based

* [Project IDX](https://idx.dev/) is an experimental initiative aimed at bringing your entire full-stack, multiplatform
  app development
  workflow to the cloud.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) buzzes with the collaborative hum of countless programmers. Public projects blossom with
  the contributions of
  many, while private code blossoms in secure gardens. Forks branch out, ideas cross-pollinate, and innovation flowers
  across a digital landscape. In this vibrant community, code whispers its secrets, shared learning empower, and the
  future of software unfolds, line by line.

#### IDEs

* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (Recommended version: Ultimate) is an integrated
  development environment written in Java for developing computer software written in Java, Kotlin, Groovy, and other
  JVM-based languages. It is developed by JetBrains and is available as an Apache 2 Licensed community edition, and in a
  proprietary commercial edition.
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is the official integrated development
  environment for Google's Android operating
  system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. It is available
  for download on Windows, macOS and Linux-based operating systems.

#### SDKs

A software development kit (SDK) is a collection of software development tools in one installable package. They
facilitate the
creation of applications by having a compiler, debugger, and sometimes a software framework. They are normally specific
to a hardware platform and operating system combination.\
The following SDKs will be used:

* Flutter
* Android
* iOS

<warning>iOS's application development necessitates the use of a MacBook. This stipulation arises from the fact that Xcode, 
Apple's designated Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for iOS and macOS app creation is exclusively available for 
macOS-based systems. It is imperative to adhere to this requirement to access the full suite of tools and resources 
provided by Xcode and ensure compliance with Apple's development guidelines. Therefore, developers are advised to 
utilize a MacBook to facilitate seamless iOS development processes.</warning>
